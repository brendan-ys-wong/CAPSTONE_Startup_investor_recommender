# Summary
This repository is a current work-in-progress, please excuse the mess.

The goal of this model is to help recommend to start-up companies which investors might be interested in investing in their companies. With over twenty-thousand
active investors in our dataset, most of whom are small-investors investing in less than 3 companies, we run into the problem where it would be difficult
and also undesirable to be trying to predict which of these small-time investors might invest, since the probability that any single small-time investors will invest is small,
and also because the benefit a smaller investor will invest in the start-up is also relatively small. Therefore, the intention of this model is to try and identify which of the larger investors is likely to be interested in the company based on that investors previous investments. There are around 300 investors that have at least 50 investments, our goal will be to attempt
to identify which of these large investors are likely to invest. The benefit to the start-up is they have a smaller list of targeted investors to chase, and if they are able to secure one of these largest investors as a lead investor, it will be much easier to secure other smaller investors to complete the fundraising round.
